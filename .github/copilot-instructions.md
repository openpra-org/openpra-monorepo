# Copilot Instructions for OpenPRA Nx Monorepo

This document defines repository-wide guidance for AI-assisted edits and code generation across the OpenPRA Nx workspace. Keep changes minimal, safe, and aligned with our architecture.

## Core Principles
- Prefer concrete edits over advice; deliver runnable, verified changes.
- Keep diffs small and focused; avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Respect existing conventions and public APIs; don’t break consumers.
- Use Nx targets (serve/build/test/lint) and validate locally before completion.
- Avoid adding heavy dependencies; prefer native/Nx/NestJS/React/EUI utilities.

## Workspace Overview
- Tooling: Nx, pnpm, TypeScript, Jest, ESLint, Webpack.
- Packages:
  - `packages/frontend/web-editor`: React 18 + TS, Elastic UI, React Router, SWR.
  - `packages/web-backend`: NestJS 10 + Mongoose 8.
  - `packages/shared-types`: Central TS types; single source of truth for MEF schemas.
  - `packages/mef-schema`: Generated MEF JSON schemas from shared-types.
  - `packages/engine/scram-node`: Node wrappers for SCRAM engine.
  - `packages/model-generator`, `packages/microservice/job-broker`: utilities/services.

## Nx Commands
- Serve all: `nx run-many -t serve --all`
- Serve individual:
  - Frontend: `nx serve frontend-web-editor`
  - Backend: `nx serve web-backend`
- Build: `nx run-many -t build`
- Test: `nx run-many -t test`
- Lint: `nx run-many -t lint`
- Graph (optional): `nx graph`

## Conventions
### TypeScript & Paths
- Use project-relative imports consistent with each package config.
- Don’t invent paths. Verify with editor or quick search.

### Frontend (web-editor)
- Routing lives under `src/app/pages` and `src/app/components/pageContainers`.
- Use React Router nested routes for model-scoped pages.
- UI: Elastic UI (EUI). Match the existing EUI version; table actions should use `type: 'icon'` with `icon` not `iconType` if needed.
- Data fetching: SWR hooks under `src/hooks`. Always return arrays to tables; handle loading/error states.
- Keep components small; colocate with feature folder under `src/components`.

### Backend (web-backend)
- NestJS modules/controllers/services live under `src/` by feature area.
- Use Mongoose schemas in `src/schemas` and inject with `MongooseModule.forFeature` in feature modules.
- Mount modules using `RouterModule.register` under `/api/...` to compose full paths.
- Validate DTOs where applicable; prefer Zod pipe already configured.
- Keep controller paths stable; avoid breaking API without coordination with frontend.

### Shared Types
- Source of truth for interfaces/types used across frontend/backend.
- Update exports in `packages/shared-types/src/lib/index.ts` when adding new types.
- When schema JSON is needed, generate via `mef-schema` package (follow existing pattern).

## Quality Gates (Green-Before-Done)
- Build: `nx run-many -t build` must pass.
- Lint: `nx run-many -t lint` must pass for changed packages.
- Tests: Add/adjust minimal tests when changing public behavior.
- For backend: ensure Nest app starts and routes are mapped (watch logs).

## PR & Diff Hygiene
- Keep PRs focused; include a concise description of user-facing impact.
- Avoid unrelated formatting; preserve existing style unless a linter dictates.
- Document any new env vars, routes, or scripts in package READMEs.

## Safe Defaults & Edge Cases
- SWR hooks: default `data` to `[]` for EUI tables; handle `isLoading` and errors.
- Mongoose models: define indexes and required fields thoughtfully; validate IDs.
- Routing: verify nested route precedence to avoid parent overshadowing children.
- Config: never commit secrets; use `.env` and documented vars.

## How to Propose Changes (AI agents)
1. Gather context (search/read relevant files).
2. Plan explicit edits (list files, what changes, why).
3. Make minimal diffs with correct paths.
4. Validate: build/serve/test where applicable.
5. Summarize outcomes and next steps; note assumptions.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- 404s on API calls: confirm RouterModule mount paths and controller prefixes.
- EUI tables crashing: ensure `items` is always an array; avoid undefined.
- Type path issues: verify `shared-types` exports and package.json dependency versions.
- Backend start warnings about transformers are informational unless build fails.

If in doubt, ask for the target route, data shape, and affected packages before large changes. Keep changes iterative and reversible.
