## Becoming a Maintainer

We welcome active contributors to join the maintainer team! Maintainers help review pull requests, triage issues, and guide the project's direction.

- Consistently contribute high-quality code, documentation, or support.
- Demonstrate understanding of the project’s goals and standards.
- Participate in code reviews and discussions.
- Show respect and collaboration within the community.

When you meet these criteria, an existing maintainer may nominate you. The current maintainers will discuss and, if there is consensus, invite you to join the maintainer team.

If you’re interested in becoming a maintainer, feel free to reach out in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/openpra-org/openpra-monorepo/discussions) or request to join the [monorepo-devs team](https://github.com/orgs/openpra-org/teams/monorepo-devs).
