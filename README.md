# OpenPRA monorepo

<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10891407"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10891407.svg" alt="DOI"></a> [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Welcome to the OpenPRA monorepo, the unified codebase for the [v2 OpenPRA App](https://v2-app.openpra.org/), which
includes the web client, backend REST APIs, distributed microservices, wrappers for underlying C/C++ probabilistic risk
assessment (PRA) engines, shared JSON schema definitions, and utility packages for automated PRA model generation.

## Internal Packages

Included within this monorepo are the following packages:

- `engine-scram-node`: Node.js wrappers for the `SCRAM` C/C++ engine.
- `frontend-web-editor`: A React v18 and TypeScript-based frontend UI.
- `mef-schema`: OpenPRA MEF JSON Schema definitions, generated using the `shared-types` package.
- `microservice-job-broker`: RabbitMQ based distributed queues for scaling quantification requests.
- `model-generator`: A tool for creating synthetic PRA models.
- `shared-types`: Pure TypeScript type definitions (no runtime/framework deps); the single source of truth for domain data types and DTOs used across apps/services.
- `shared-sdk`: Runtime SDK with `AuthService`, `ApiManager`, roles and invites APIs, and predefined roles (imports types from `shared-types`).
- `mef-types`: MEF technical element TypeScript types extracted from `shared-types` for clearer separation of MEF concerns.
- `web-backend`: A NestJS REST-API backend service written in TypeScript.

We're managing this monorepo using the [Nx](https://nx.dev) build system, which enables flexible package bundling. For
instance, the `mef-schema` package centralizes the
[OpenPRA-MEF (Model Exchange Format) JSON definitions](https://docs.openpra.org/en/model-exchange-formats), generated
from the TypeScript definitions specified in the `shared-types` package.

# Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Node.js v20.17.0** (managed via **nvm**)
- **pnpm** (Package Manager)
- **MongoDB**
- **RabbitMQ**

## Installation

### 1. Install **nvm** (Node Version Manager)

#### macOS and Linux

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc` for Zsh).

#### Windows

Download and run the [nvm Windows installer](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/latest/download/nvm-setup.zip).

### 2. Install **`node`**

Once installed, `nvm` can be used to download and use the `node` version of choice. Install it using `nvm` with the
following commands:

```shell
nvm install 20.17.0
nvm use 20.17.0
```

### 3. Install **pnpm** (Package Manager)

#### macOS and Linux

Run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

Ensure `pnpm` is added to your `PATH`. You may need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

#### Windows

Run:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 4. Install **MongoDB**

Follow the official MongoDB installation guide for your operating system:

- **macOS**: [Install MongoDB on macOS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
- **Windows**: [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
- **Linux**: [Install MongoDB on Linux](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/)

## Setup

Once prerequisites are installed, initialize the project with these commands:

```shell
pnpm setup
pnpm install
```

We recommend using the local Nx CLI via pnpm in this workspace (no global install required). You can verify Nx with:

```bash
pnpm nx --version
```

## Running the Project

### Start All Services Concurrently

To serve all packages at once, run one of the following:

```bash
pnpm run dev:all
# or
pnpm nx run-many -t serve --all
```

### Start Individual Services

To serve a specific package, run:

- **Web Editor**:

  ```bash
  pnpm nx serve frontend-web-editor
  ```

- **Web Backend**:

  ```bash
  pnpm nx serve web-backend
  ```

## Testing and Linting

### Run Tests

Execute Jest unit tests:

```bash
pnpm nx run-many -t test
```

### Run Linting

Check code quality with ESLint:

```bash
pnpm nx run-many -t lint
```

### Nx Cloud caching (optional)

If you see local warnings about Nx Cloud not being connected (401), you can either connect the workspace to Nx Cloud
for distributed caching or use local caching only. For most local development, using the local Nx CLI via `pnpm nx`
is sufficient without connecting Nx Cloud.

## Jest + SWC (fast TypeScript tests)

We use `@swc/jest` for TypeScript transforms in most packages for faster tests. Key notes:

- NestJS projects (decorators required)
  - Enable decorators and metadata in the Jest transform options
  - Use CommonJS modules for Jest

  Example transform block in `jest.config.ts`:

  ```ts
  transform: {
    "^.+\\.[tj]s$": [
      "@swc/jest",
      {
        jsc: {
          parser: { syntax: "typescript", decorators: true },
          target: "es2020",
          transform: { decoratorMetadata: true },
        },
        module: { type: "commonjs" },
        sourceMaps: "inline",
      },
    ],
  }
  ```

- Path mapping for workspace packages
  - When tests import from sources, add `moduleNameMapper` so Jest resolves to TS files:

  ```ts
  moduleNameMapper: {
    // shared-types (pure types library)
    "^shared-types/src/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/../shared-types/src/$1",
    "^shared-types/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/../shared-types/src/$1",
    "^shared-types$": "<rootDir>/../shared-types/src/index.ts",

    // mef-types (types only)
    "^mef-types/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/../mef-types/src/$1",
    "^mef-types$": "<rootDir>/../mef-types/src/index.ts",
  }
  ```

  Tip: for types-only packages (like `mef-types`), prefer `import type { ... } from 'mef-types/...'` to avoid runtime resolution of `.d.ts` files under SWC.

- Debian 12 MongoDB tip
  - On Debian 12/bookworm, `mongodb-memory-server` may fail due to OpenSSL 1.1. Our Jest setups auto-detect and fall back to `MONGO_URI` when possible. See
    [Troubleshooting (Debian 12 / OpenSSL 3)](#troubleshooting-debian-12--openssl-3) for details.

### Troubleshooting (Debian 12 / OpenSSL 3)

If you run backend tests on Debian 12 (bookworm) or a container based on it, you might hit OpenSSL 1.1 binary issues with `mongodb-memory-server`. Our Jest setup in the backend auto-detects this environment and will use a locally running MongoDB if available. You can opt-in explicitly by setting `MONGO_URI`:

```bash
# Example: run tests against a local MongoDB instance
export MONGO_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test"
pnpm nx test web-backend -- --test-timeout=60000
```

For more details, see `packages/web-backend/README.md`.

## Versioning & Releases (Nx Release)

We use Nx Release with Conventional Commits to version the monorepo, generate changelogs, publish to npm, and create GitHub releases.

- Local dry-run (no files changed):

```bash
pnpm nx release version --dry-run
```

- Full local release (apply changes):

```bash
# 1) Bump versions from conventional commits
pnpm nx release version

# 2) Generate/update changelog(s)
pnpm nx release changelog

# 3) Publish to npm (requires NPM_TOKEN)
pnpm nx release publish

# 4) Create a GitHub Release from the new tag(s)
pnpm nx release github
```

- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Manual dispatch supports a dry-run toggle.
  - On pushes to `main`, the workflow builds and tests. Use manual dispatch to apply version/changelog/publish steps.
  - Required GitHub secrets:
    - `NPM_TOKEN` for publishing to npm.
    - `MONGO_URI` for backend tests in CI.

Notes:

- We default to a single global version across the workspace (configured in `nx.json`).
- Backend tests in certain local containers (Debian 12) require `MONGO_URI` to point to an external MongoDB.

## Conventional Commits, Commitlint & Husky

Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits. A Husky `commit-msg` hook runs Commitlint to enforce this.

- Format: `type(scope): short description`
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`.

Examples:

```text
feat(web-editor): add searchable initiator list
fix(web-backend): handle invalid ObjectId in GET /items/:id
chore(release): add commitlint + husky hook
```

Getting blocked by the hook?

```bash
# Amend your last commit message to conform
git commit --amend
git push --force-with-lease
```

Husky installs automatically via the `prepare` script on `pnpm install`. If hooks are missing, re-run `pnpm install`.

## Docs

Generate the aggregated documentation site with a single command:

```bash
pnpm nx run docs:build-site
```

Outputs:

- Aggregated site: `dist/docs` (published by the GitHub Pages workflow at `.github/workflows/docs.yml`).
- Per-package HTML docs remain under each package, for example:
  - `packages/shared-types/docs`
  - `packages/shared-sdk/docs`
  - C++ Doxygen HTML for SCRAM: `packages/engine/scram-node/docs/cpp/html`
- Optional Markdown docs (local only):
  - `packages/shared-types/docs-md`
  - `packages/shared-sdk/docs-md`

The Pages workflow is named "Docs: Unified TypeScript + C++" and runs on pushes to `main` or manual dispatch.

### Docs coverage

Run a quick TSDoc coverage report across key packages:

```bash
pnpm nx run docs:coverage
```

This prints, per package, how many exported declarations have TSDoc blocks and highlights low-coverage areas to target first. Itâ€™s local-only and safe to run anytime.

## Additional Documentation

Additional documentation can be found in the [Extended README](README/README.md)
section.

## Deploy and lockfile

Deployments run Nx targets inside a single repository image that is installed from the root `pnpm-lock.yaml`. We do not
generate pruned lockfiles or `dist/package.json` files during webpack builds for server apps (e.g., `web-backend`,
`microservice-job-broker`). Instead, production images rely on the root-installed workspace dependencies.

- Why: avoids pnpm v9 pruned-lockfile edge cases and keeps builds simpler and faster.
- Where configured: per app `project.json` with `generateLockfile: false` and `generatePackageJson: false` under the
  webpack build target.
- If your deploy flow expects a `dist/package.json`, you can re-enable `generatePackageJson` in that app and ensure your
  environment supports pruned lockfile generation.
