## How to contribute (summary)

- Fork the repo and create branches from `main`.
- Open an issue for major changes to align on scope.
- Keep diffs focused; update docs/tests where applicable.

## Pull Requests

1. Create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure tests and lints pass locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm nx run-many -t lint
   pnpm nx run-many -t test
   ```
3. Use Conventional Commits for messages, e.g.:
   - `feat(web-editor): add graph search`
   - `fix(web-backend): handle invalid ObjectId`
4. Link the PR to the related issue with GitHub keywords.

## Coding standards

- TypeScript: follow ESLint rules in the repo. Prefer clear names and small modules.
- Tests: add/adjust minimal unit/integration tests for behavioral changes.
- Docs: update the unified docs site when public behavior changes.

## Docs and coverage (informational)

- Build docs locally:
  ```bash
  pnpm nx run docs-md:site:build --no-cloud
  ```
- Coverage report (TypeScript symbol/param/return):
  ```bash
  pnpm nx run docs-md:site:coverage --no-cloud
  ```
  The CI publishes a non-blocking summary and annotations; thresholds can be enforced later.

## Dev Container

We provide a Dev Container with MongoDB and RabbitMQ. See the Dev Container guide for setup and tips.
