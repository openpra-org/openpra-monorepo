# Release Notes v0.11.2 : Case-Sensitive Model Initialization

This micro release makes model initialization and validation facilities language-agnostic.
The initialization facilities preserve the original representation of names and references
without normalization except for trimming leading and trailing whitespace characters,
which simplifies internationalization.

The release clarifies the support for the UTF-8, UTF-16, and other encodings in input files,
and specifies the encoding for report files (UTF-8).


## Removed Features

- Case-insensitive model initialization and validation


## Bug Fixes

- 10 - 100x performance regression in model initialization from input
  (noticeable only for large models with 1000 or more events).
