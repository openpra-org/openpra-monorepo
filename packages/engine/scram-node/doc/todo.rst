Low Hanging Fruits
==================

- `Issues on GitHub <https://github.com/rakhimov/scram/issues>`_
- `TODO list in the core code <https://scram-pra.org/api/todo.xhtml>`_
- `TODO list in the GUI code <https://scram-pra.org/gui-api/todo.xhtml>`_
- `Bugs and Issues <https://github.com/rakhimov/scram/blob/develop/doc/bugs.rst>`_


.. note:: The following To-Do items are features with high uncertainties.
          Upon becoming more certain (realistic, clear, ready, doable),
          the items should graduate to GitHub issues.

.. note:: Relative, subjective importance within groups is tagged in *italics*.
          The order of items is arbitrary (i.e., irrelevant).
