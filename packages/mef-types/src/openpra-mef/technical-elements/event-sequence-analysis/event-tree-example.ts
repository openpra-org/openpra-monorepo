  EVENT TREE TO EVENT SEQUENCE RELATIONSHIP:
  ------------------------------------------
  
  For the Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP) event tree:
  
  1. The event tree represents a structured, graphical model of possible progression paths
     following a loss of offsite power initiating event.
     
  2. Each path through the event tree (from initiating event to end state) corresponds to
     a unique event sequence, representing a specific chronological progression of events.
     
  3. For example:
     - The path IE-LOOP → EDG Success → PORVs Success → SEQ-1 corresponds to event sequence ES-LOOP-1
     - The path IE-LOOP → EDG Failure → Battery Failure → SEQ-5 corresponds to event sequence ES-LOOP-5
     
  4. The event tree models multiple possible event sequences at once, capturing all the ways
     the scenario might unfold based on the success or failure of systems and operator actions.
     
  5. The event tree allows for quantifying the frequencies of different sequences by assigning
     probabilities to each branch point and calculating combined probabilities for each path.
     
  6. Dependencies between events in the sequence (e.g., how one system's failure affects another)
     can be captured in the event tree structure or in the branch point probabilities.
