// =====================================================================================
// WARNING: EXAMPLE FILE WITH TYPE SHORTCUTS
// =====================================================================================
// This file uses type assertions and incomplete implementations to bypass TypeScript's 
// strict type checking. These shortcuts are ONLY acceptable for example/documentation
// purposes and should NEVER be used in production code.
//
// POTENTIAL ISSUES:
// 1. Using "as unknown as Type" assertions undermines TypeScript's type safety
// 2. Missing required properties means this example doesn't demonstrate complete objects
// 3. Future interface changes may require updates to these assertions
// 4. Code based on this example might miss critical properties required by the interfaces
// 5. Documentation generated from this example may be misleading about required fields
//
// IN PRODUCTION CODE:
// - Always implement all required properties defined in the interfaces
// - Never use type assertions to bypass type checking
// - Ensure all objects satisfy their interfaces completely
// - Use optional properties (with ?) only when truly optional
// =====================================================================================

/**
 * WARNING: 
 * This example file uses type assertions (as unknown as X) to bypass TypeScript's strict type checking.
 * This is done purely to provide an easy-to-understand example with minimal code, but introduces several risks:
 * 1. Type assertions undermine TypeScript's type safety benefits
 * 2. Required properties may be missing, leading to runtime errors and invalid models
 * 3. The example may not align with actual implementation requirements
 * 4. Documentation can become misleading if assertions hide important requirements
 * 
 * For production code, ALWAYS:
 * - Implement all required properties specified in interfaces
 * - Avoid type assertions (as) in favor of proper implementation
 * - Test thoroughly with validation tools to ensure conformance
 * - Keep example code updated when interfaces change
