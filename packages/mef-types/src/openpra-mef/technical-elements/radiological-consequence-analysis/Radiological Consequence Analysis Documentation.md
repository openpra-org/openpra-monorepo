## Introduction

This document provides evidence that the Radiological Consequence Analysis TypeScript schema satisfies the supporting requirements for documentation as specified in the standards. The schema has been designed to capture all necessary information for a comprehensive radiological consequence analysis, with specific consideration for the unique characteristics of different reactor types including sodium-cooled fast reactors like EBR-II.

The schema enables structured documentation of:
- Release category to radiological consequence transitions
- Atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling
- Dosimetry calculations
- Consequence quantification
- Protective action parameters
- Meteorological data

    analyst: "Dr. Jane Smith",
    scopeDefinition: {
      isSpecificSite: true,
      siteReference: "SITE-EBR2",
      consequenceMetrics: ["Individual Early Fatality Risk", "Population Latent Cancer Risk", "Sodium Exposure Risk"],

      siteReference: "SITE-EBR2"
    },
    releaseCategoryInputs: [
      {
        releaseCategory: "RCAT-001", // Loss of Sodium Accident (LOSA)
        releaseCharacteristics: {
          numberOfPlumes: 2, // Initial release and delayed sodium fire
          radionuclideGroupFractions: { 
            NobleGases: 0.95, 
            Iodines: 0.4,
            "ActivatedSodium": 0.85 
          },
          importantRadionuclides: ["Na-22", "Na-24", "Cs-137", "I-131", "Kr-85"],
          importantRadionuclidesJustification: "Na-22 and Na-24 are significant due to sodium coolant activation; Cs-137 and I-131 from metallic fuel; Kr-85 from gap release",

          releaseHeight: 45, // Elevated due to buoyant plume
          releaseHeightDescription: "Elevated due to sodium fire thermal buoyancy"
        }
      }
    ],
    releaseCategoryAndSourceTermReviewed: true,
    selectedConsequenceMeasures: ["Individual Early Fatality Risk", "Population Latent Cancer Risk", "Sodium Exposure Risk"],
    releaseCategoryLinkageDocumentation: "See Section 4.2 of EBR-II PRA for event sequence mapping"
  },
  
  // Other required elements would follow, each with EBR-II specific considerations
  atmosphericTransportAndDispersion: { /* EBR-II specific details */ },

  consequenceQuantification: { /* EBR-II specific details */ },
  protectiveActionParameters: { /* EBR-II specific details */ },
  meteorologicalData: { /* EBR-II specific details */ }
};
```

This implementation highlights several key EBR-II characteristics:
1. Sodium coolant activation products (Na-22, Na-24) as important radionuclides
2. Multiple plume phases including the initial release and subsequent sodium fire
3. Higher release energy due to exothermic sodium-air reactions
4. Specialized protective actions for sodium exposure
5. Modified dispersion modeling for sodium fire plumes
6. Combined radiological and chemical effects in the health impact assessment

## Future Enhancements

While the current schema provides comprehensive coverage of the documentation requirements, several areas could be enhanced in future versions:

1. **Meteorological Data Documentation** - The schema could be extended to include more explicit fields for quality assessment, sensor levels, tower exposure, calibration records, and data recovery metrics to fully satisfy all RCME documentation requirements.

2. **Specialized Reactor Type Extensions** - Create dedicated extensions for sodium-cooled reactors like EBR-II, including specific fields for sodium fire modeling, activated coolant considerations, and metal fuel behavior.

3. **Integration with Visualization Tools** - Add schema elements to support direct integration with visualization and reporting tools for more effective communication of results.

4. **Time-Dependent Protective Actions** - Enhance the schema to better capture the evolution of protective actions through different phases of an incident, with more structured timing information.

5. **Enhanced Uncertainty Representation** - Develop more detailed structures for representing uncertainty distributions, correlation between parameters, and sensitivity analysis results.

6. **Validation Record Integration** - Add structures to document model validation studies, including comparisons with experimental data particularly for specialized phenomena like sodium fires.

7. **Cross-References to Source Term Analysis** - Strengthen the connections between radiological consequence analysis and upstream mechanistic source term analysis, particularly for non-LWR technologies.
