 *
 * @remarks **HLR-IE-A**: The Initiating Event Analysis shall reasonably identify all initiating events for all modeled plant operating states and sources of radioactive material consistent with the PRA scope and plant pre-operational stage.
 * @remarks **IE-A5**: INCLUDE in the spectrum of initiating event challenges at least the following general categories: (a) transient INCLUDE among the transient category both equipment- and human-induced events that disrupt the plant and leave the reactor coolant system boundary (RCB) intact. DELINEATE transient initiators in a manner that resolves the unique challenges to the reactor-specific safety functions; (b) RCB breach INCLUDE in the RCB breach category both equipment- and human-induced events that disrupt the plant by causing a breach in the reactor coolant system (RCS) with a resulting loss of coolant inventory or pressure. DELINEATE the RCB breach initiators, using a defined rationale for the differentiation; (c) interfacing systems RCB breaches INCLUDE postulated events in systems interfacing with the RCS that could fail or be operated in such a manner as to result in an uncontrolled loss of core coolant or release of radioactive material bypassing a radionuclide transport barrier as applicable; (d) special initiators; (e) any of the above caused by an internal plant hazard; (f) any of the above caused by an external hazard; (g) other categories of initiating events caused by at-initiator human failure events.
 * @remarks **IE-A6**: When identifying initiating events caused by internal or external hazards, INCLUDE initiating events caused by a combination of hazards (e.g., seismically induced fires, flooding caused by fire sprinkler actuation) included in the scope of the PRA.
