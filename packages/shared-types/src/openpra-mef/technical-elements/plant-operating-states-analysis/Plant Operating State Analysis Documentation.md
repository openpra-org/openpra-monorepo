## 1. POS-D1 Compliance

### 1.1 Selection and Definitions of Plant Evolutions (POS-D1.a)

The schema captures plant evolutions through the `plantEvolutions` field in the `PlantOperatingStatesAnalysis` interface:

```typescript
plantEvolutions: PlantEvolution[];
```

Each `PlantEvolution` contains detailed definitions as required:

```typescript
export interface PlantEvolution extends Unique, Named {
    description?: string;
    operatingModes: string[];
    rcbConfigurations: string[];
    rcsParameters: {
        powerLevel?: number;
        temperature?: number;
        pressure?: number;
        coolantInventory?: number;
    };
    availableInstrumentation: string[];
    activitiesLeadingToChanges: string[];
    radionuclideTransportBarriersStatus: string[];
    sscCapabilitiesChanges: string[];
    operationalAssumptions: string[];
    plantOperatingStates: PlantOperatingState[];
    // Additional fields...
}
```

The schema also tracks whether at-power operations are included in the analysis as required by regulation:

```typescript
includesAtPowerOperations: boolean;
```

#### Sample Documentation for Plant Evolutions

**Plant Evolution: Normal Power Operation**

- **Description**: Normal operation from startup to shutdown
- **Operating Modes**: POWER, STARTUP, SHUTDOWN
- **RCB Configurations**: Pressure boundary intact, Vented for maintenance
- **RCS Parameters**: Power level: 100%, Temperature: 550°F, Pressure: 2250 psia
- **Available Instrumentation**: Reactor pressure, Reactor temperature, Neutron flux
- **Activities Leading to Changes**: Load following, Startup sequence, Normal shutdown
- **Radionuclide Barriers Status**: All barriers intact during power operation
- **SSC Capabilities Changes**: No changes during normal operation
- **Operational Assumptions**: Reactor operates at full power for 90% of operational time

### 1.2 Process and Criteria Used to Identify Plant Operating States (POS-D1.b)

The schema documents the identification process through the `PlantOperatingStatesDocumentation` interface:

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingStatesDocumentation {
    // Process description for POS identification
    identificationProcessDetails: string;
    // Other fields...
}
```

Each `PlantOperatingState` is clearly defined with unique boundaries:

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingState extends Unique, Named {
    description?: string;
    characteristics?: string;
    processCriteriaIdentification?: string;
    timeBoundary: TimeBoundary;
    // Other fields...
}
```

The `TimeBoundary` interface ensures clear delineation between states:

```typescript
export interface TimeBoundary {
    startingCondition: string;
    endingCondition: string;
    transitionParameters?: TransitionParameter[];
}
```

#### Sample Documentation for POS Identification Process

**POS Identification Process**:

1. Analyzed the complete plant operating cycle from initial startup to shutdown
2. Identified distinct plant conditions based on:
   - Reactor power levels
   - RCS configuration
   - Equipment availability
   - Decay heat levels
   - Barrier statuses
3. Defined explicit time boundaries for each POS
4. Verified mutual exclusivity using the `POSValidationRules` interface
5. Confirmed collective exhaustivity to ensure complete coverage of the operating cycle

**POS Identification Criteria**:
- Changes in major safety function availability
- Changes in barrier status
- Significant changes in plant parameters (e.g., RCS pressure/temperature)
- Changes in decay heat removal capabilities
- Changes in reactor coolant inventory
- Significant operator actions or alignments

### 1.3 Process and Criteria Used to Group Plant Operating States (POS-D1.c)

The schema supports grouping of plant operating states through the `plantOperatingStatesGroups` field:

```typescript
plantOperatingStatesGroups?: PlantOperatingStatesGroup[];
```

Each group has detailed documentation of the process:

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingStatesGroup extends Unique, Named {
    description?: string;
    plantOperatingStateIds: string[];
    groupingJustification: string;
    representativeCharacteristics: string[];
}
```

The schema also tracks subsumed operating states:

```typescript
subsumedPOSs?: SubsumedPOS[];
```

Each subsumed POS is documented with clear justification:

```typescript
export interface SubsumedPOS {
    subsumedPOS: string;
    subsumingPOS: string;
    justification: string;
    riskImpact?: "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW";
    limitations?: string[];
    validationMethod?: string;
}
```

#### Sample Documentation for POS Grouping Process

**POS Grouping Criteria**:
1. Similar decay heat levels
2. Similar RCS configurations
3. Similar available equipment
4. Similar initiating events
5. Similar success criteria

**Grouping Process**:
1. Evaluated each POS against the grouping criteria
2. Identified POSs with similar characteristics
3. Performed sensitivity analysis to verify that grouping doesn't mask risk insights
4. Documented justification for each grouping decision
5. Maintained the most limiting characteristics for each group

**Example Grouping Justification**: POS-5A and POS-5B were grouped because they share similar decay heat levels (0.5-0.7% of rated power), identical RCS configurations (vented, reduced inventory), and the same set of available safety systems. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that using the parameters from POS-5A (the more limiting case) provides conservative results for both states.

### 1.4 Definition of Each Plant Operating State Group (POS-D1.d)

The schema provides detailed definitions of each POS group through the `PlantOperatingStatesGroup` interface:

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingStatesGroup extends Unique, Named {
    description?: string;
    plantOperatingStateIds: string[];
    groupingJustification: string;
    representativeCharacteristics: string[];
}
```

#### Sample Documentation for POS Group Definition

    availableInstrumentation: string[];
    radionuclideTransportBarrier: RadionuclideTransportBarriers;
    initiatingEvents: InitiatingEvent[];
    safetyFunctions: SafetyFunction[];
    // Additional fields...
}
```

The `ReactorCoolantSystemParameters` interface specifically captures key parameters:

```typescript
export interface ReactorCoolantSystemParameters {
    powerLevel: [number & tags.Minimum<0>, number & tags.Maximum<1>];
    decayHeatLevel: [number & tags.Minimum<0>, number & tags.Maximum<1>];

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingState {
    // Other fields...
    meanDuration: number;
    meanTimeSinceShutdown?: number;
    meanFrequency?: Frequency;
}
```

The schema also supports detailed frequency and duration analysis:

```typescript
export interface OperatingStatesFrequencyDuration {
    outagePlansRecords: { /* fields */ }[];
    maintenancePlansRecords: { /* fields */ }[];
    operationsData: { /* fields */ }[];
    tripHistory: { /* fields */ }[];
    summary?: {
        posName: string;
        averageDuration: number;
        entriesPerYear: number;
        fractionOfTime: number;

```typescript
export interface ReactorCoolantSystemParameters {
    // Other fields...
    decayHeatLevel: [number & tags.Minimum<0>, number & tags.Maximum<1>];
    timeAfterShutdown?: number;
}
```

Time-varying decay heat is further captured through:

```typescript
export interface TimeVaryingCondition extends Unique, Named {
    time: number;
    parameter: string;
    value: number;
    impact: string;
    units?: string;
    uncertainty?: number;
    requiresMonitoring: boolean;
}
```

#### Sample Documentation for Decay Heat Association

**Decay Heat Levels by POS in Normal Operation Evolution**:

| POS ID | POS Name               | Min Decay Heat (%) | Max Decay Heat (%) | Time After Shutdown (hrs) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| POS-1  | Full Power             | 7.0                | 7.0                | N/A                       |
| POS-2  | Reactor Trip           | 7.0                | 6.0                | 0-1                       |
| POS-3  | Hot Standby            | 6.0                | 4.0                | 1-4                       |
| POS-4  | Cooldown               | 4.0                | 2.5                | 4-24                      |
| POS-5A | Mid-Loop (Early)       | 2.5                | 1.7                | 24-48                     |
| POS-5B | Mid-Loop (Late)        | 1.7                | 0.7                | 48-96                     |

### 1.8 Specific Interfaces with Other PRA Tasks (POS-D1.h)

The schema includes explicit interfaces with other PRA tasks:

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingStatesDocumentation {
    // Other fields...
    praTaskInterfaces: string;
}
```

Additionally, cross-references to other technical elements exist throughout:

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingState {
    // Other fields...
    initiatingEvents: InitiatingEvent[];
    successCriteriaIds?: SuccessCriteriaId[];
}
```

#### Sample Documentation for PRA Task Interfaces

**Interfaces with Other PRA Tasks**:

1. **Initiating Event Analysis**: The POS Analysis provides the operational context for initiating event identification and quantification. Each POS has a defined set of applicable initiating events referenced through the `initiatingEvents` field.

2. **Success Criteria Analysis**: POS-specific success criteria are referenced through the `successCriteriaIds` field. Each POS has unique thermal-hydraulic conditions that affect system success criteria.

3. **Systems Analysis**: The availability and configuration of systems in each POS are captured in the `decayHeatRemoval` field. This information feeds into the systems analysis task.

4. **Human Reliability Analysis**: POS-specific operator actions are documented in the `evolutionConsiderations.operatorActions` field. This information supports human reliability analysis for different plant conditions.

5. **Data Analysis**: Historical data on POS frequencies and durations is captured in the `OperatingStatesFrequencyDuration` interface. This provides input to the Data Analysis technical element.

**Example Interface Control**:
When the Success Criteria Analysis is updated, the corresponding success criteria IDs in the POS Analysis are verified for consistency. Likewise, when new initiating events are identified, they are mapped to the appropriate POS definitions.

## 2. POS-D2 Compliance

### 2.1 Schema Support for Model Uncertainty Documentation

The schema includes specific structures to document model uncertainties, related assumptions, and alternatives:

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingStatesAnalysis {
    // Other fields...
    
    /** 
     * Sources of model uncertainty related to POS definitions
     * @implements POS-A12
     */
    modelUncertainty?: ModelUncertaintyInfo[];
    
    // Additional fields for documentation
    documentation?: PlantOperatingStatesDocumentation;
}
```

The `ModelUncertaintyInfo` interface provides a structured way to document these uncertainties:

```typescript
export interface ModelUncertaintyInfo {
    /** Source of the uncertainty */
    source: string;
    
    /** Description of the uncertainty */
    description: string;
    
    /** Impact level of the uncertainty */
    impact: "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW";
    
    /** How the uncertainty is treated in the model */
    treatment: string;
    
    /** Reasonable alternatives that could be considered */
    reasonableAlternatives?: string[];
}
```

This structure allows comprehensive documentation of uncertainties, their impact, treatment approaches, and alternative treatments, fully satisfying POS-D2.

### 2.2 Example Model Uncertainty Documentation

Below is an example of how model uncertainties would be documented using the schema:

```typescript
const posAnalysis: PlantOperatingStatesAnalysis = {
  // Other fields...
  
  modelUncertainty: [
    {
      source: "Decay Heat Calculation Method",
      description: "The ANS 1979 decay heat model includes uncertainties that impact time-to-boil calculations in low-power states",
      impact: "MEDIUM",
      treatment: "Used ANS 1979 + 2σ uncertainty to ensure conservative time windows",
      reasonableAlternatives: [
        "ANS 1994 decay heat model with plant-specific adjustments",
        "Use of actual measured data from similar plants to refine the model"
      ]
    },
    {
      source: "Plant Evolution Timeline",
      description: "Limited operational experience causes uncertainty in duration of transitional states",
      impact: "LOW",
      treatment: "Used conservative estimates based on similar plant designs",
      reasonableAlternatives: [
        "Use shorter durations to assess impact on overall risk profile"
      ]
    },
    {
      source: "Success Criteria in Transitional States",
      description: "Thermal-hydraulic analyses have higher uncertainty during rapidly changing conditions",
      impact: "HIGH",
      treatment: "Used bounding analysis at multiple snapshots within each transitional state",
      reasonableAlternatives: [
        "Dynamic thermal-hydraulic modeling throughout the transition",
        "More granular subdivision of transitional states"
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

This example shows how the schema effectively documents:
- The sources of model uncertainty
- Detailed descriptions of each uncertainty
- The relative impact of each uncertainty
- How the uncertainty is treated in the analysis
- Reasonable alternative approaches that could be considered

Such documentation satisfies the requirements of POS-D2 by providing a structured approach to capturing model uncertainties and assumptions.

## 3. POS-D3 Compliance

### 3.1 Schema Support for Pre-operational Limitations

The schema includes a dedicated structure to document assumptions and limitations due to the lack of as-built, as-operated details:

```typescript
export interface PlantOperatingStatesAnalysis {
    // Other fields...
    
    /** 
     * List of assumptions due to lack of as-built details
     * @implements POS-A13, POS-B8
     */
    assumptionsLackOfDetail?: AssumptionsLackOfDetail[];
    
    // Documentation and other fields
}
```

The `AssumptionsLackOfDetail` interface is specifically designed to address POS-D3:

```typescript
export interface AssumptionsLackOfDetail {
    /**
     * Description of the assumption made
     */
    description: string;
    
    /**
     * Influences of plant operating state definitions
     */
    influence: string;
    
    /**
     * Impact assessment of this assumption on risk
     */
    riskImpact: "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW";
    
    /**
     * Justification for the assumption
     */
    justification?: string;
    
    /**
     * Planned actions to validate or refine this assumption
     */
    plannedActions?: string[];
    
    /**
     * Affected plant operating states
     */
    affectedPOSIds?: string[];
    
    /**
     * Potential alternatives to this assumption
     */
    potentialAlternatives?: string[];
    
    /**
     * Sensitivity analysis results, if performed
     */
    sensitivityAnalysis?: string;
}
```

This interface captures all aspects needed for POS-D3, including the description of assumptions, their influence on POS definitions, risk impact assessment, justification, planned validation actions, affected operating states, alternatives, and sensitivity analysis results.

### 3.2 Example Pre-operational Limitations Documentation

Below is an example of how pre-operational limitations would be documented using the schema:

```typescript
const posAnalysis: PlantOperatingStatesAnalysis = {
  // Other fields...
  
  assumptionsLackOfDetail: [
    {
      description: "RCS temperature distribution during mid-loop operations",
      influence: "Affects success criteria for decay heat removal systems in POS-5A and POS-5B",
      riskImpact: "HIGH",
      justification: "No as-built instrument locations available to confirm thermal stratification",
      plannedActions: [
        "Confirm thermal-hydraulic assumptions with scale model testing",
        "Add additional temperature sensors during commissioning"
      ],
      affectedPOSIds: ["POS-5A", "POS-5B"],
      potentialAlternatives: [
        "Conservative uniform temperature assumption",
        "Detailed CFD modeling with sensitivity studies"
      ],
      sensitivityAnalysis: "Sensitivity studies show mid-loop operation risk estimates may vary by a factor of 2-3 depending on temperature distribution assumptions"
    },
    {
      description: "Operator response times for non-routine evolutions",
      influence: "Affects time available for operator actions in transitional states",
      riskImpact: "MEDIUM",
      justification: "No operating crew performance data available pre-operation",
      plannedActions: [
        "Conduct timed simulator exercises during training",
        "Refine estimates after initial plant operation"
      ],
      affectedPOSIds: ["POS-3", "POS-4", "POS-5A"],
      sensitivityAnalysis: "Sensitivity study assuming 1.5x longer response times shows acceptable safety margins maintained"
    },
    {
      description: "System alignment transition times during outage activities",
      influence: "Affects vulnerability windows for specific initiating events",
      riskImpact: "MEDIUM",
      justification: "Limited information on maintenance procedures and crew coordination",
      plannedActions: [
        "Develop detailed maintenance procedures",
        "Benchmark against similar plant outage data",
        "Update PRA after first refueling outage"
      ],
      affectedPOSIds: ["POS-4", "POS-5A", "POS-6"],
      potentialAlternatives: [
        "Use of bounding estimates from industry experience",
        "Application of uncertainty factors to account for variations"
      ],
      sensitivityAnalysis: "Sensitivity studies show that even with 2x longer alignment times, core damage frequency remains below threshold"
    }
  ]
};
```

This example shows how the schema effectively documents:
- Assumptions made due to lack of as-built, as-operated details
- How these assumptions influence POS definitions
- Risk impact assessments
- Justifications for the assumptions
- Planned actions to validate or refine assumptions during commissioning
- Affected plant operating states
- Potential alternative approaches
- Results of sensitivity analyses

Such documentation satisfies the requirements of POS-D3 by providing a structured approach to capturing pre-operational limitations and plans to address them.

## 4. Configuration Control and Traceability

The schema ensures traceability through unique identifiers and explicit cross-references:

```typescript

Each POS, evolution, and group has a unique identifier that can be referenced across the PRA model. This ensures changes can be tracked and impacts assessed across the model.

The comprehensive structure of the `PlantOperatingStatesAnalysis` schema ensures that all documentation requirements of POS-D1, POS-D2, and POS-D3 can be satisfied in a consistent, traceable manner. By providing structured interfaces for all required documentation elements, the schema facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements while supporting efficient documentation practices.
