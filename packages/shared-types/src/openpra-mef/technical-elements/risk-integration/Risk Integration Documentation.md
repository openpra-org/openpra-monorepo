## Introduction

This document analyzes how the provided TypeScript schema for Risk Integration satisfies the Supporting Requirements as specified in the regulatory guidance. The schema is designed to support Probabilistic Risk Assessments (PRA) and provides comprehensive structures to ensure that the documentation of Risk Integration provides traceability of the work.

The primary objective is to demonstrate that the schema's design enables the creation of documentation that fully complies with requirements, ensuring that all aspects of risk integration work are traceable, comprehensible, and supportive of regulatory compliance.

## Documentation Coverage Analysis

### Schema Overview

The TypeScript schema includes dedicated interfaces for documenting the Risk Integration process. The primary interfaces that address regulatory requirements are:

- `RiskIntegrationDocumentation`: Encompasses the entire RI-D1 requirement for documenting the Risk Integration process
- `RiskIntegrationAssumption`: Addresses the RI-D2 requirement for documenting sources of model uncertainty and related assumptions
- `ModelUncertaintySource`: Provides detailed structure for documenting uncertainty sources
- `RiskUncertaintyAnalysis`: Supports documentation of uncertainty analyses
- `SignificantRiskContributors`: Enables documentation of risk-significant contributors

## Regulatory Requirements Coverage

### Process Documentation

"DOCUMENT the process used in the Risk Integration, specifying what is used as input, the applied methods, and the results"

The table below maps each sub-requirement of RI-D1 to the corresponding schema elements:

| Requirement | Description | Schema Element | Coverage |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| RI-D1(a) | Process description | `RiskIntegrationDocumentation.processDescription` | Full |
| RI-D1(b) | Risk significance criteria | `RiskIntegrationDocumentation.riskSignificanceCriteriaDescription` | Full |
| RI-D1(c) | Risk calculation methods | `RiskIntegrationDocumentation.calculationMethodsDescription` | Full |
| RI-D1(d) | Uncertainty analysis | `RiskIntegrationDocumentation.uncertaintyAnalysisDescription` | Full |
| RI-D1(e) | Key assumptions | `RiskIntegrationDocumentation.keyAssumptionsDescription` | Full |
| RI-D1(f) | Limitations | `RiskIntegrationDocumentation.limitationsDescription` | Full |
| RI-D1(g) | Risk insights | `RiskIntegrationDocumentation.riskInsights` | Full |
| RI-D1(h) | Risk contributors | `SignificantRiskContributors` interface and various `significantContributors` fields | Full |

#### RI-D1(a): Overall Process Description

The schema provides a field for documenting the overall process used in Risk Integration:

```typescript
/** 
 * Description of the process used in the Risk Integration analysis [156, RI-D1(a)].
 * Includes what is used as input, the applied methods, and the results.
 */
processDescription: string;
```

Example implementation:

```typescript
processDescription: "The risk integration process for this NLWR PRA incorporates event sequence families from Event Sequence Quantification and release categories from Mechanistic Source Term Analysis. A Monte Carlo simulation approach with 10,000 trials was used to propagate uncertainties in both frequency and consequence measures. Results are presented as point estimates, mean values, and complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs)."
```

#### RI-D1(b): Risk Significance Criteria

The schema provides a field for documenting the risk significance criteria:

```typescript
/** 
 * Description of the risk significance criteria used [156, RI-D1(b)].
 * Includes both absolute and relative criteria.
 */
riskSignificanceCriteriaDescription: string;
```

Additionally, the `RiskSignificanceCriteria` interface provides detailed structure for defining these criteria:

```typescript
export interface RiskSignificanceCriteria extends Unique, Named {
    description?: string;
    criteriaType: RiskSignificanceCriteriaType | string;
    metricType: RiskMetricType | string;
    absoluteThresholds?: { /* threshold definitions */ };
    relativeThresholds?: { /* threshold definitions */ };
    justification: string;
    // Additional fields...
}
```

#### RI-D1(c): Risk Calculation Methods

The schema provides a field for documenting the methods used to calculate overall risk:

```typescript
/** 
 * Description of the methods used to calculate the overall risk [156, RI-D1(c)].
 * Includes approaches for calculating integrated risk metrics.
 */
calculationMethodsDescription: string;
```

The `IntegratedRiskResults` interface further supports this documentation with fields like:

```typescript
calculationApproach: {
    pointEstimateApproach?: boolean;
    meanValueApproach?: boolean;
    frequencyConsequencePlots?: boolean;
    exceedanceFrequencyCurves?: boolean;
    alternativeApproach?: string;
    justification: string;
};
```

#### RI-D1(d): Uncertainty Analysis

The schema provides a field for documenting the uncertainty analysis:

```typescript
/** 
 * Description of the uncertainty analysis performed [156, RI-D1(d)].
 * Includes characterization and quantification of uncertainties.
 */
uncertaintyAnalysisDescription: string;
```

The comprehensive `RiskUncertaintyAnalysis` interface further supports this documentation:

```typescript
export interface RiskUncertaintyAnalysis extends Unique, Named {
    description?: string;
    metric: RiskMetricType | string;
    propagationMethod: string;
    parameterUncertainty?: { /* uncertainty details */ };
    keyUncertaintySources?: ModelUncertaintySource[];
    relatedAssumptions?: Assumption[];
    // Additional fields...
}
```

#### RI-D1(e): Key Assumptions

The schema provides a field for documenting key assumptions:

```typescript
/** 
 * Description of the key assumptions made in the Risk Integration [156, RI-D1(e)].
 * Includes sources of model uncertainty and related assumptions.
 */
keyAssumptionsDescription: string;
```

The `RiskIntegrationAssumption` interface provides a detailed structure for these assumptions:

```typescript
export interface RiskIntegrationAssumption extends Unique {
    description: string;
    originatingElement: TechnicalElementTypes;
    basis: string;
    impact: string;
    alternatives?: string[];
    // Additional fields...
}
```

#### RI-D1(f): Analysis Limitations

The schema provides a field for documenting the limitations of the analysis:

```typescript
/** 
 * Description of the limitations of the Risk Integration analysis [156, RI-D1(f)].
 * Includes limitations due to the lack of as-built, as-operated details.
 */
limitationsDescription: string;
```

Example implementation:

```typescript
limitationsDescription: "This analysis is limited by the availability of operational data since the facility is not yet built. The PRA relied on design information and engineering judgment to establish failure rates and human error probabilities. These limitations will be addressed during the operational phase through data collection and model updates."
```

#### RI-D1(g): Risk Insights

The schema provides a field for documenting risk insights:

```typescript
/** 
 * Risk insights derived from the Risk Integration analysis [156, RI-D1(g)].
 * Includes insights about significant contributors to risk.
 */
riskInsights?: string[];
```

Example implementation:

```typescript
riskInsights: [
  "Passive cooling systems demonstrate high reliability but are sensitive to specific common cause failure mechanisms",
  "Loss of heat sink scenarios dominate the risk profile due to the extended mission time requirements",
  "Human errors during maintenance activities represent significant contributors to overall plant risk"
]
```

#### RI-D1(h): Risk Contributors

The schema provides a comprehensive interface for documenting risk contributors:

```typescript
export interface SignificantRiskContributors extends Unique {
    metricType: RiskMetricType | string;
    description?: string;
    significantEventSequences?: RiskContributor[];
    significantSystems?: RiskContributor[];
    significantComponents?: RiskContributor[];
    significantBasicEvents?: RiskContributor[];
    // Additional fields...
}
```

The interface supports documentation of various contributor types as required by RI-D1(h).

### Model Uncertainty Documentation

"DOCUMENT the sources of model uncertainty, related assumptions, and reasonable alternatives (as identified in Requirement RI-C1) associated with the Risk Integration."

The schema provides specific interfaces for documenting model uncertainties and assumptions:

```typescript
export interface ModelUncertaintySource extends Unique, Named {
    description: string;
    originatingElement: TechnicalElementTypes;
    impactScope: TechnicalElementTypes[];
    affectedMetrics: (RiskMetricType | string)[];
    impactAssessment: string;
    characterizationMethod?: string;
    alternatives?: {
        description: string;
        potentialImpact: string;
    }[];
    // Additional fields...
}

export interface RiskIntegrationAssumption extends Unique {
    description: string;
    originatingElement: TechnicalElementTypes;
    basis: string;
    impact: string;
    alternatives?: string[];
    // Additional fields...
}
```

These interfaces ensure that all aspects of RI-D2 are addressed in the schema.

## Schema Implementation

### Documentation Interfaces

The schema implements several key interfaces that support documentation requirements:

| Interface | Purpose | RI-D Requirements Addressed |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------|
| `RiskIntegrationDocumentation` | Primary documentation structure | RI-D1(a) through RI-D1(g) |
| `SignificantRiskContributors` | Documents risk contributors | RI-D1(h) |
| `ModelUncertaintySource` | Documents uncertainty sources | RI-D2 |
| `RiskIntegrationAssumption` | Documents assumptions | RI-D2 |
| `RiskUncertaintyAnalysis` | Documents uncertainty analyses | RI-D1(d), RI-D2 |

### Traceability Implementation

The schema implements traceability through several mechanisms:

1. **Cross-references**: The schema uses reference types (e.g., `EventSequenceReference`, `ReleaseCategoryReference`) to link between technical elements.

2. **Explicit Traceability Fields**:
   ```typescript
   additionalMetadata?: {
       // ...
       traceability?: string;
       eventSequenceAnalysisReferences?: { /* ... */ }[];
       mechanisticSourceTermReferences?: { /* ... */ }[];
   };
   ```

3. **Feedback Mechanisms**: The schema includes fields for documenting feedback to other technical elements:
   ```typescript
   eventSequenceAnalysisFeedback?: { /* ... */ };
   mechanisticSourceTermFeedback?: { /* ... */ };
   ```

4. **Validation Rules**: The schema includes validation rules to ensure documentation completeness:
   ```typescript
   validationRules?: RiskIntegrationValidationRules;
   ```

## Usage Example: Simplified EBR-II Based Analysis

While not modeling EBR-II specifically, we can reference aspects of its design to illustrate how the schema supports documentation requirements.

Consider a simplified risk integration documentation for a sodium-cooled fast reactor similar to EBR-II:

```typescript
// Example documentation for a sodium-cooled fast reactor
const riskIntegrationDoc: RiskIntegrationDocumentation = {
  uuid: "ri-doc-1",
  processDescription: "This risk integration analysis focuses on the sodium-cooled fast reactor design, incorporating passive safety features similar to those demonstrated in EBR-II's 1986 loss-of-flow tests. The analysis integrates event sequences from internal events, seismic events, and internal flooding with mechanistic source term evaluations.",
  
  riskSignificanceCriteriaDescription: "Risk significance criteria include both absolute thresholds based on regulatory limits and relative thresholds identifying components that contribute more than 5% to overall risk metrics.",
  
  calculationMethodsDescription: "Risk metrics were calculated using both point estimates and mean values from Monte Carlo simulations. Frequency-consequence plots were developed to visualize the risk profile across the spectrum of potential consequences.",
  
  uncertaintyAnalysisDescription: "Uncertainties were characterized through parameter distributions for component failure rates and propagated using 10,000 Monte Carlo trials. Model uncertainties, particularly in sodium fire progression and aerosol behavior, were addressed through sensitivity studies.",
  
  keyAssumptionsDescription: "Key assumptions include passive reactor shutdown capability under loss-of-flow conditions, similar to that demonstrated in EBR-II tests, and assumptions regarding sodium fire progression rates derived from experimental data.",
  
  limitationsDescription: "This analysis is limited by the availability of sodium-cooled reactor operational experience in commercial settings. While EBR-II and other experimental reactors provide valuable insights, scaling effects introduce uncertainties when applied to commercial-scale designs.",
  
  riskInsights: [
    "Passive safety features provide significant risk reduction for loss-of-flow scenarios",
    "Sodium leaks and fires represent the dominant contributor to offsite release risk",
    "Secondary heat removal system reliability is a key factor in long-term cooling capability"
  ]
};
```

This example demonstrates how the schema supports comprehensive documentation of the risk integration process while referencing relevant aspects of EBR-II's design and operational experience.
