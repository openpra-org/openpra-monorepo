## Introduction

This document validates that the TypeScript schema for Systems Analysis is compliant with the "Supporting Requirements" as defined in the standard. The schema provides interfaces and data structures that enable comprehensive documentation of Systems Analysis according to these requirements.

The primary objective of Regulatory guidance is to ensure that the documentation of Systems Analysis provides traceability of the work. The TypeScript schema implements this through structured interfaces that capture all required information.

## Schema Overview

The Systems Analysis TypeScript schema implements a comprehensive set of interfaces and types that enable documentation of system models, dependencies, uncertainties, and assumptions as required by Regulators. Key modules in the schema include:

- Core definitions and enumerations
- System modeling and failure modes
- Fault tree analysis
- Dependencies and common cause analysis
- Engineering analysis and validation
- Documentation and traceability

The schema provides dedicated interfaces for meeting Regulatory requirements, including `ProcessDocumentation`, `ModelUncertaintyDocumentation`, and other interfaces that inherit from base documentation classes.

Additionally, the schema includes minimal interfaces for specific system aspects:
- `SupportSystemSuccessCriteria`: For documenting success criteria of support systems
- `EnvironmentalDesignBasisConsideration`: For identifying components that may operate beyond design basis
- `InitiationActuationSystem`: For modeling system initiation and actuation

The schema provides dedicated interfaces for meeting Regulatory requirements, including `ProcessDocumentation`, `ModelUncertaintyDocumentation`, and other interfaces that inherit from base documentation classes.

## Regulatory Requirements Coverage

This section demonstrates how the schema enables compliance with each of the supporting requirements for Regulatory Compliance.

### SY-C1

The schema provides the `ProcessDocumentation` interface that extends `BaseProcessDocumentation` with systems-specific documentation requirements:

```typescript
export interface ProcessDocumentation extends BaseProcessDocumentation {
  systemFunctionDocumentation?: Record<SystemReference, string>;
  systemBoundaryDocumentation?: Record<SystemReference, string>;
  // Additional properties addressing SY-C1 requirements
  // ...
}
```

The following sections demonstrate how each SY-C1 sub-requirement is covered by the schema with concise examples.

#### SY-C1a

**Schema Coverage:**
```typescript
// ProcessDocumentation interface
systemFunctionDocumentation?: Record<SystemReference, string>;

// Also in SystemDefinition interface
description?: string;
```

**Example:**
```typescript
// Example for EBR-II primary cooling system
const processDoc: ProcessDocumentation = {
  systemFunctionDocumentation: {
    "SYS-PCS": "The primary cooling system circulates liquid sodium through the reactor core and intermediate heat exchanger to remove heat under normal and emergency operations. During normal operation, it transfers heat to the secondary system. During emergency conditions, it provides decay heat removal via natural circulation."
  }
};
```

#### SY-C1b

**Schema Coverage:**
```typescript
// ProcessDocumentation interface
systemBoundaryDocumentation?: Record<SystemReference, string>;

// Also in SystemDefinition interface
boundaries: string[];
```

**Example:**
```typescript
const systemDef: SystemDefinition = {
  id: "SYS-PCS-001",
  name: "Primary Cooling System",
  boundaries: [
    "From reactor vessel inlet plenum to outlet plenum",
    "Primary sodium pumps",
    "Intermediate heat exchangers",
    "All associated piping within containment",
    "Excluding secondary sodium system boundary"
  ]
};
```

#### SY-C1c

**Schema Coverage:**
```typescript
// ProcessDocumentation interface
systemSchematicReferences?: Record<SystemReference, {
  reference: string;
  description: string;
}>;

// Also in SystemDefinition interface
schematic?: {
  reference: string;
  description?: string;
};
```

**Example:**
```typescript
const processDoc: ProcessDocumentation = {
  systemSchematicReferences: {
    "SYS-SCS": {
      reference: "Drawing EBR-II-SCS-P001",
      description: "Piping and Instrumentation Diagram for EBR-II Shutdown Cooling System"
    }
  }
};
```

#### SY-C1d

**Schema Coverage:**
```typescript
// ProcessDocumentation interface
equipmentOperabilityDocumentation?: Record<string, {
  system: SystemReference;
  component: string;
  considerations: string;
  calculationReferences?: string[];
}>;

// Also in SystemDefinition interface
operabilityConsiderations?: {
  component: string;
  calculationRef?: string;
  notes?: string;
}[];
```

**Example:**
```typescript
const systemDef: SystemDefinition = {
  // Other properties...
  operabilityConsiderations: [
    {
      component: "Primary Sodium Pump P-1",
      calculationRef: "CALC-EBR-PCS-007",
      notes: "Calculation confirms pump can operate at up to 550°C sodium temperature"
    }
  ]
};
```

#### SY-C1e

**Schema Coverage:**
```typescript
// ProcessDocumentation interface
operationalHistoryDocumentation?: Record<SystemReference, string[]>;

// Also in SystemDefinition interface
operationalHistory?: string[];
```

**Example:**
```typescript
const processDoc: ProcessDocumentation = {
  operationalHistoryDocumentation: {
    "SYS-SCS": [
      "Actuated during 1971 loss of power event; performed as designed",
      "Three instances of minor NaK leakage identified in operational history",
      "Natural circulation capability confirmed during test in 1969"
    ]
  }
};
```

#### SY-C1f

**Schema Coverage:**
```typescript
// ProcessDocumentation interface
successCriteriaDocumentation?: Record<SystemReference, {
  criteria: string;
  relationshipToEventSequences: string;
}>;

// Also in SystemDefinition interface
successCriteria: string | SystemSuccessCriterion | SuccessCriteriaId;

// Also in SupportSystemSuccessCriteria interface
export interface SupportSystemSuccessCriteria extends Unique {
  systemReference: SystemReference;
  successCriteria: string;
  criteriaType: "conservative" | "realistic";
  supportedSystems: SystemReference[];
}
```

**Note:** The `SuccessCriteriaId` type is imported from the shared patterns module (`shared-patterns.ts`) to maintain consistency across the codebase and avoid duplicate type definitions.

**Example:**
```typescript
const processDoc: ProcessDocumentation = {
  successCriteriaDocumentation: {
    "SYS-SCS": {
      criteria: "At least one natural circulation path available with sufficient heat removal capacity to maintain primary sodium below 550°C",
      relationshipToEventSequences: "Required for all sequences involving loss of forced circulation in accident sequences AS-LOFC-001 through AS-LOFC-015"
    }
  }
};

// Example for support system success criteria
const supportSystemCriteria: SupportSystemSuccessCriteria = {
  id: "SSSC-001",
  systemReference: "SYS-CCW",
  successCriteria: "At least one CCW pump and heat exchanger train providing minimum flow of 5000 gpm",
  criteriaType: "realistic",

  relevantPhysicalPhenomena: ["Thermal expansion", "Buoyancy-driven flow", "Natural convection heat transfer"],
  uncertaintyAnalysis: "Monte Carlo simulation of thermal-hydraulic parameters",
  uncertaintyEvaluation: "Key uncertainties include flow resistance factors and heat transfer coefficients"
};
```

### SY-C2

The schema includes the `ModelUncertaintyDocumentation` interface that extends `BaseModelUncertaintyDocumentation` to address SY-C2 requirements:

```typescript
export interface ModelUncertaintyDocumentation extends BaseModelUncertaintyDocumentation {
  systemSpecificUncertainties?: Record<SystemReference, {
    uncertainties: string[];
    impact: string;
  }>;
  
  reasonableAlternatives: {
    alternative: string;
    reasonNotSelected: string;
    applicableSystems?: SystemReference[];
  }[];
}
```

### SY-C3

The schema leverages the base `PreOperationalAssumption` interface type which is imported from the core documentation module:

```typescript
import { 
    // ... other imports
    BasePreOperationalAssumptionsDocumentation,
    PreOperationalAssumption
} from "../core/documentation";
```

## Template Management

The schema includes comprehensive support for managing component templates and their instances:

```typescript
export interface TemplateInstanceRegistry extends Unique {
    /** Registry of instances organized by template */
    instancesByTemplate: Record<string, string[]>;
    
    /** Current version of each template */
    templateVersions: Record<string, string>;
    
    /** History of changes to templates */
    changeHistory: TemplateChangeRecord[];
    
    /** Configuration for propagating changes */
    propagationConfig: TemplatePropagationConfig;
}

export interface TemplateChangeRecord {
    /** Reference to the template that was changed */
    templateReference: string;
    
    /** Version of the template after the change */
    version: string;
    
    /** Timestamp when the change was made */
    timestamp: string;
    
    /** Description of changes made to the template */
    changes: string[];
    
    /** Indicates if changes have been propagated to instances */
    changesPropagated: boolean;
    
    /** Instances to exclude from change propagation */
    excludedInstances?: string[];
}
```

This structure enables:
- Tracking of template versions and changes
- Management of template instances
- Controlled propagation of template changes
- Exclusion of specific instances from updates

## Safety Function Mapping

The schema includes dedicated support for mapping systems to safety functions:

```typescript
export interface SystemToSafetyFunctionMapping extends Unique {
    /** Reference to the system */
    systemReference: SystemReference;
    
    /** Safety functions this system supports */
    safetyFunctions: string[];
    
    /** Event sequences where this system is credited */
    eventSequences: string[];
}
```

This enables clear documentation of:
- Which safety functions each system supports
- Event sequences where systems are credited
- Traceability between systems and safety functions

## Environmental Considerations

The schema includes comprehensive support for environmental considerations:

```typescript
export interface EnvironmentalDesignBasisConsideration extends Unique {
    /** Reference to the system */
    systemReference: SystemReference;
    
    /** Components that may operate beyond environmental design basis */
    components: string[];
    
    /** Event sequences where this may occur */
    eventSequences: string[];
    
    /** Environmental conditions beyond design basis */
    environmentalConditions: string;
}
```

This structure enables documentation of:
- Components operating beyond design basis
- Associated event sequences
- Specific environmental conditions
- Impact on system performance

## Implementation Examples

This section provides simplified examples of how the schema enables documentation of EBR-II systems.

### EBR-II Passive Safety Features Example

The schema enables documentation of EBR-II's passive safety features through the `PassiveSystemsTreatment` interface:

```typescript
// Example instantiation for EBR-II passive safety features
const passiveSafetyFeatures: PassiveSystemsTreatment = {
  id: "PSF-EBR-II-001",
  name: "EBR-II Passive Reactivity Feedback",
  systemReference: "SYS-CORE",
  description: "Natural properties that enhance reactor safety through relatively benign responses to accidents",
  relevantPhysicalPhenomena: [
    "Negative temperature coefficient of reactivity",
    "Natural circulation cooling",
    "Thermal expansion of structures"
  ],
  uncertaintyAnalysis: "Monte Carlo simulation of reactivity feedback mechanisms",
  uncertaintyEvaluation: "Comprehensive evaluation of uncertainties in thermal expansion coefficients and flow resistance"
};
```

The schema's `ProcessDocumentation` interface would then enable documentation of these passive safety features:

```typescript
// Example documentation of passive systems
const processDocumentation: ProcessDocumentation = {
  // Other documentation properties...
  passiveSystemsDocumentation: {
    "SYS-CORE": {
      description: "EBR-II's core incorporates passive safety features that rely on natural properties rather than active mitigation",
      uncertaintyEvaluation: "Uncertainties in natural circulation and reactivity feedback were evaluated through thermal-hydraulic analysis and reactor physics calculations"
    }
  }
};
```

### EBR-II Shutdown Cooling System Example

The Shutdown Cooling System can be documented using the `SystemDefinition` interface:

```typescript
// Example instantiation for EBR-II Shutdown Cooling System
const shutdownCoolingSystem: SystemDefinition = {
  id: "SYS-SCS-001",
  name: "EBR-II Shutdown Cooling System",
  description: "Passive system designed to remove decay heat from the primary sodium when the secondary system is inoperable",
  boundaries: [
    "Primary sodium boundary",
    "NaK natural circulation loop",
    "Air-cooled heat exchangers"
  ],
  successCriteria: "Maintain primary sodium temperature below 500°C during shutdown conditions",
  missionTime: "72 hours",
  modeledComponentsAndFailures: {
    "NaK-HX-001": {
      failureModes: ["FAILURE_TO_TRANSFER_HEAT", "EXTERNAL_LEAKAGE"],
      justificationForInclusion: "Critical for passive heat removal capability"
    },
    "AIR-DAMPER-001": {
      failureModes: ["FAILURE_TO_OPEN", "FAILURE_TO_REMAIN_OPEN"],
      justificationForInclusion: "Required for establishing natural draft air flow"
    }
  },
  testAndMaintenance: [
    "Monthly verification of damper operability",
    "Quarterly thermal performance test"
  ],
  modelAssumptions: [
    "Natural circulation is adequate to remove decay heat",
    "No operator actions required for 24 hours"
  ]
};
```

## Requirements Coverage Summary

## Core Definitions

The schema includes several core definitions that are fundamental to systems analysis:

### Component States

Components can be in various states during operation:

```typescript
export type ComponentState = 
  | "operational"  // Normal operation
  | "degraded"     // Operating but with reduced capability
  | "failed"       // Complete loss of function
  | "recovering"   // Being restored to service
  | "maintenance"; // Under planned maintenance
```

This enables modeling of:
- Normal operation conditions
- Degraded operation states
- Complete failure states
- Recovery processes
- Maintenance periods

### Plant Operating States

The schema includes support for referencing plant operating states:

```typescript
/**
 * Reference to a plant operating state
 * Format: POS-[NAME] (e.g., POS-FULL-POWER)
 */
export type PlantOperatingStateReference = string & tags.Pattern<"^POS-[A-Z0-9_-]+$">;

/**
 * Simple reference to plant operating states for a system
 */
export interface PlantOperatingStatesReference {
  /** List of plant operating states where this system is required */
  states: PlantOperatingStateReference[];
  
  /** Optional description of how the system's requirements vary across states */
  stateSpecificRequirements?: Record<PlantOperatingStateReference, string>;
}
```

This enables:
- Standardized referencing of plant operating states
- Documentation of system requirements across different operating states
- Implementation of SY-B14 requirements
- Clear traceability between systems and their operating state requirements

### Dependency Types

The schema defines various types of system dependencies:

```typescript
export enum DependencyType {
  /** Functional dependency (e.g., power, control, cooling) */
  FUNCTIONAL = "FUNCTIONAL",
  
  /** Spatial dependency (e.g., shared location) */
  SPATIAL = "SPATIAL",
  
  /** Environmental dependency (e.g., temperature, radiation) */
  ENVIRONMENTAL = "ENVIRONMENTAL",
  
  /** Human dependency (e.g., shared operator actions) */
  HUMAN = "HUMAN",
  
  /** Other dependencies not covered by the above */
  OTHER = "OTHER"
}
```

This enables comprehensive modeling of:
- Functional dependencies between systems
- Spatial dependencies in shared locations
- Environmental dependencies affecting multiple systems
- Human dependencies in shared operations
- Other types of dependencies not covered by the standard categories

### Repair Modeling

The schema includes comprehensive support for repair modeling:

```typescript
export interface SystemBasicEvent extends BasicEvent {
  /** Whether repair is modeled for this basic event */
  repairModeled?: boolean;
  
  /** Justification for modeling repair */
  repairJustification?: string;
  
  /** Mean time to repair, if repair is modeled */
  meanTimeToRepair?: number;
}
```

This enables:
- Explicit modeling of repair processes
- Documentation of repair modeling justification
- Quantification of repair times
- Implementation of SY-A31 requirements

### Resource Depletion

The schema includes detailed support for modeling resource depletion:

```typescript
export interface DepletionModel extends Unique {
  /** Type of resource being depleted */
  resourceType: "fuel" | "coolant" | "battery" | "other";
  
  /** Description of the resource */
  description?: string;
  
  /** Initial quantity available */
  initialQuantity: number;
  
  /** Rate at which the resource is consumed */
  consumptionRate: number;
  
  /** Units of measurement for consumption rate */
  units: string;
  
  /** Component or system using this resource */
  associatedSystem?: SystemReference;
  
  /** Whether depletion leads to immediate failure or degraded operation */
  depletionFailureMode?: string;
  
  /** Time required for resource recovery */
  recoveryTime?: number;
}
```

This enables modeling of:
- Various types of consumable resources
- Resource consumption rates
- System dependencies on resources
- Failure modes due to resource depletion
- Resource recovery processes

## Conclusion

The TypeScript schema for Systems Analysis has been validated against the "Supporting Requirements for Regulatory Compliance." The schema provides comprehensive interfaces and data structures that enable documentation of Systems Analysis in accordance with these requirements.

The schema provides comprehensive support for SY-C1 through SY-C3 requirements, with dedicated interfaces for process documentation, model uncertainty documentation, and pre-operational assumptions documentation, demonstrated through EBR-II specific examples.
