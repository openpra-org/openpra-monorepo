  /**
  * @link https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#include
  * Specifies an array of filenames or patterns to include in the program. These filenames are resolved relative to the
  * directory containing the tsconfig.json file.
  *
  * include and exclude support wildcard characters to make glob patterns:
  * '*'  matches zero or more characters (excluding directory separators)
  * '?'  matches any one character (excluding directory separators)
  * '**' matches any directory nested to any level
  * If the last path segment in a pattern does not contain a file extension or wildcard character, then it is treated as
  * a directory, and files with supported extensions inside that directory are included (e.g. .ts, .tsx, and .d.ts by
  * default, with .js and .jsx if allowJs is set to true).
