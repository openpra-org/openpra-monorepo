 * 1. The JWT Strategy (AuthGuard('jwt')) is going to extract the 'Authorization' property from the request header.
 *    The Authorization property has the format: 'JWT <token>'.
 *    This <token> is extracted and then the expiration is checked (the token expires 24 hours after it is generated).
 *    The encrypted information (the User object) from the token is decrypted using a 'secret key' known by the user only.
 *    The secret key is set as an environment variable ('JWT_SECRET_KEY') in '.env' file.
 * 2. After decrypting the User object, it is sent to the validate function where the User data (userID, username, email) is separated.
